# Assessment

## Task

In the project, you can find order history page JSON filed under `responses` folder. You have to:

- parse these files
- support pagination functionality (once user gets to the end of the list, next page should be loaded). First page is: `0ffyf9wd9jrk.json`.
- display data in the table view (image in response is a standard system icon from SFSymbols)

Some basic implementations are already presented in the code below.

## Notes

What should be taken into account:

- You can use any tools and any libraries (even Google)
- You can use any architecture
- You can use Swift
- Your solution should support later replacement local JSON with network results

## Main criteria

- It works
- Architecture
- Scalability
- Readability

**PS:** Despite the task looks very simple, the final solution should be created for long-term support, and it should be well-extensible.
